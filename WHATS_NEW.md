# What's New - Enhanced Edition

## 🆕 Major Upgrades from Basic Version

### 1. YOLOv8-seg Garment Segmentation (NEW!)

**Before (MediaPipe)**:
```
Camera → Body pose detection → Landmark-based splitting
         ↓                      ↓
    Shoulders, hips, knees  →  Guess regions
         ↓                      ↓
    Top = shoulders-hips   ❌  Fails with layers
    Bottom = hips-knees    ❌  Fails with dresses
    Shoes = ankles-down    ❌  Often missed
```

**After (YOLOv8-seg)**:
```
Camera → YOLOv8 instance segmentation
         ↓
    Per-garment detection with masks
         ↓
    Instance 0: Jacket (#5432) ✅
    Instance 1: Shirt (#5433)  ✅
    Instance 2: Pants (#5434)  ✅
    Instance 3: Left Shoe      ✅
    Instance 4: Right Shoe     ✅
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Detects layered clothing (jacket + shirt)
- ✅ Handles dresses, skirts, unusual poses
- ✅ 13 fashion categories (vs 3 guessed)
- ✅ Clean per-garment masks
- ✅ Confidence scores per detection

### 2. FashionCLIP Semantic Search (NEW!)

**Before (Basic)**:
```
Garment → Color histogram (HSV)
         ↓
    96-dim feature vector
         ↓
    FAISS search
         ↓
    Top 5 results (color-only matching) ❌
```

**After (FashionCLIP)**:
```
Garment crop + Description
         ↓
    FashionCLIP encoder (vision + text)
         ↓
    512-dim embedding (semantic + visual)
         ↓
    FAISS HNSW search
         ↓
    Top 30 candidates
         ↓
    Re-rank by category + color (LAB Delta E)
         ↓
    Top 5 results (semantically similar) ✅
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ 57% better than base CLIP on fashion

         ↓
    Jittery, flickering bubbles ❌
```

**After (EMA Filtering)**:
```
Frame 1: Red detected → Red bubble (alpha=0.3)
Frame 2: Orange detected → Smooth blend to red-orange

```
RGB color space
- Not perceptually uniform
- "Red" might match "Orange"
- Poor for color similarity
```

**After (LAB K-means)**:
```
LAB color space (CIE L*a*b*)
- Perceptually uniform
- Delta E distance = human perception
- Accurate color matching
- K-means clustering (k=3)
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Human-like color perception

- Hard to track which bubbles belong to whom
```

**After (Collision Groups)**:
```
Person 0: Collision group -1 (no self-collision)
Person 1: Collision group -2 (no self-collision)
         ↓
Person 0 bubbles ↔ Person 1 bubbles (collide)
Person 0 bubbles ↛ Person 0 bubbles (no collision)
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Each person's bubbles stay together
- ✅ Clean bubble clusters per person
- ✅ Spatial offset (250px per person)
- ✅ Supports 1-2 people smoothly

---

### 7. 60 FPS Rendering (NEW!)

**Before**:
```
ML processing: 30 FPS
Rendering: 30 FPS (tied together)
         ↓
If ML slows down → Rendering stutters ❌
```

**After (Decoupled)**:
```
ML processing: 15-30 FPS (variable)
Rendering: 60 FPS (always)
         ↓
Smooth visuals even if ML varies ✅
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ 60 FPS rendering guaranteed
- ✅ Fixed timestep physics
